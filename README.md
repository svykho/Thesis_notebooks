# Thesis_notebooks

This repository contains the Mathematica/Python notebooks used to study perturbations in black holes and ringdown properties. At the moment, it consists of:
- Tutorial for the Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit.
- Perturbation notebooks (Vitor Cardoso).
- GW_Rdown contains notebooks to generate ringdown models, calculate frequencies and damping of QNMs, and estimate final mass and spin (Xisco Jiménez).
- RD_Fits contains notebooks to fit ringdowns of different waveforms (Xisco Jiménez).
- pynr allows to retrieve waveforms from the RIT, MAYA and SXS catalogs (Xisco Jiménez).
- teuk-fortran-2020 solves the Teukolsky equation for the linear perturbation of psi4, reconstruct the metric from psi4, and solve the second order teukolsky equation for the second order perturbation of psi4, all about a Kerr black hole background (Justin Ripley).

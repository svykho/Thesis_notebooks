# Thesis_notebooks

This repository contains the Mathematica/Python notebooks used to study perturbations in black holes and ringdown properties. At the moment, it consists of:
- Tutorial for the Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit.
- Perturbation notebooks (Vitor Cardoso).
- GW_Rdown contains notebooks to generate ringdown models, calculate frequencies and damping of QNMs, and estimate final mass and spin (Xisco Jiménez).
- RD_Fits contains notebooks to fit ringdowns of different waveforms (Xisco Jiménez).
- pynr allows to retrieve waveforms from the RIT, MAYA and SXS catalogs (Xisco Jiménez).
- teuk-fortran-2020 solves Teukolsky equation for the linearly perturbed Newman-Penrose scalar Psi4 about a Kerr black hole (Justin Ripley).
